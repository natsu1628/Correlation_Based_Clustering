# Correlation_Based_Clustering
This repo contains code and results for project done in the field of Graph Mining.

This project does an analysis on different correlation based clustering using the S&P 500 stock data, namely, DBSCAN, Hierarchical clustering, and Correlation Clustering. A Mod-CC-PIVOT algorithm was also developed from the CC-PIVOT algorithm.
